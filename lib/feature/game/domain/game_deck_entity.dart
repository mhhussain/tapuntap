// define deck - this is an immutable copy of the deck loaded in
// define game deck - this is the current game deck and will operate as a stack
//                    deck will be drawn from and can be shuffled or reset
//                    a series of methods will need to be written to handle these operations

// deck operations:
// 1. shuffle
// 2. draw
// 3. reset
// 4. draw X
